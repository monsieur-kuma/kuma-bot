# Automatic Expired Cookie Removal

- When your cookies expire, they can no longer be used for check-ins or code redemption. To optimize your experience, the bot will automatically check and remove expired cookies at: 20:00 on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday every week (UTC +7)

- This process will not affect your account or personal data.

- This process only removes expired cookies and does not affect active cookies.
